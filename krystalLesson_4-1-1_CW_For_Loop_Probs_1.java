//Problem1 Write a class named Problem1 with a main method and a for loop that counts upward from 1 to 10, each value on its own line.

//Problem2 Write a class named Problem2 with a main method and a for loop that counts upward from -1 to 9 on one line with spaces between the numbers.

//Problem3 Write a class named Problem3 with a main method and a for loop that prints all the even numbers from 0 to 50, inclusive,
// on one line with spaces between the numbers.

//Problem4 Write a class named Problem4 with a main method and a for loop that prints all the numbers from 1 to 20 on a single line with spaces between then
// prints the sum of 1 to 20 inclusive.

//Problem5 Write a class named Problem5 with a main method and a for loop that prints 5 rows of 7 stars (Suggestion: make a String of stars)

//Problem10  Write a class named Problem5 with a main method and a for loop that prints each value in the following array with one value per line:
int [] primeArray = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 23, 29};

//Problem11 Write a class named Problem6 with a main method and a for loop that subtracts 2 to each value in the 
//following array, then prints those values on a single line with spaces between the numbers:
int [] primeArray = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 23, 29};

//Problem12 Write a class named Problem4 with a main method and a for loop that subtracts 2 to each value in the 
//following array, then puts those values into a new array called primeArray2
int [] primeArray = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 23, 29};

//Problem13 Write a class named Problem4 with a main method and a for loop that takes a number and find the number of digits (ASK MRS C FOR HELP HERE)

//Problem14 Write a class named Problem4 with a main method and a for loop takes the numbers 1 to 21 inclusive and find both the average and the sum

//Problem15 Write a class named Problem4 with a main method and a for loop that takes the numbers 1 to 10 and prints the sum of the cubes of those numbers
