//Write a class and main method with a nested for loop to solve all of the following problems

//Problem1 Write Java code to print a block of letters using the letter "a", given 4 rows and 3 columns
a a a
a a a
a a a
a a a

//Problem2 Write Java code to print a block of letters using the letter "b" given x rows and y columns, where x and y can be any number.
//Test it with x = 2, y = 4, then x = 5, y = 10, the check what happens with 0, a negative number and x > y.

//Problem3 Write a nested for loop that prints 7 stars on the first line, 6 stars on the second line...down to 
// one star on the last line.

//Problem4 Write Java code to reverse Problem3, printing 1 star on the first line, 2 on the second line down to 7 on the last line

//Problem5 Write Java code to combine problem3 and problem4 using TWO nested loops to make a triangle pattern with 7 across the middle

//Problem8 Write Java code to take all the letters in a string and print them one per line.
String name = "Crosspoint Academy";

//Problem9 Write Java code to replace all the "a" substrings in "California Crosspoint Academy" with the letter "b"

//Problem10 Write Java code to concatenate a given string with itself of a given number of times.  Use this string: "Hey" and concatenate 6 times.
