//Write code for each of the following.  When you are done save the file as a .java file and send to Mrs. C via Schoology under the array classwork assignment.
//The name of the file must be firstName Array CW.  Example: joniArrayCW.java

//Declare an array
an int array named myArray
int [] myArray;

a double array named pricesForRestaurant
double [] pricesForRestaurant;

a boolean array named trueOrFalse
boolean [] trueOrFalse;

//Declare an array of a a given size and type
an int array with 5 items named listOfNumbers
int [] listOfNumbers = new int[4];

a double array with 10 items named listOfPrices
double [] listOfPrices = new double[9];

a boolean array with 3 items named codeList
boolean [] codeList = new boolean[2];

a String array with 5 items name keyWords
String keyWords = new String[4];

//Declare an array with a given size and name with a given set of values
an int array named contestantsPerStage with 5 items and values 8, 6, 17, 4, 12
int [] contestantsPerStage = {8, 6, 17, 4, 12};

a double array named morePrices with 6 items and values 1.20, 3.45, 6.10, 2.50, 4.30, 5.10
double [] morePrices = {1.20, 3.45, 6.10, 2.50, 4.30, 5.10};

a boolean array named codeLogic with 4 items and values true, true, true, false
boolean [] codeLogic = {true, true, true, false}

a String array named advancedPlacementCS with 9 items and values Connor, Devin, Clarance, Nancy, Drey, Catherine, Herman, Elijah, Journey 
String [] advancedPlacementCS = {"Connor", "Devin", "Clarance", "Nancy", "Drey", "Catherine", "Herman", "Elijah", "Journey"};

//remember Strings must be in double quotes!!


//Array indexes
Given the following array, given the index and value of each item
String [] listOfBibleNames = {"Peter", "Ruth", "Solomon", "David", "Rachel", "Mary", "Andrew", "Esther", "Adam", "Eve"};

//Example: listOfBibleNames[0] is Peter.

//Who is in index 4
Rachel

//Who is in index 7
Esther

//Who is in index 10 (tricky question)
out of bounds error, there is no index 10

//Write the index for David
listOfBibleNames[3]

//Write the index for Mary
listOfBibleNames[5]

//Write the index for Adam
listOfBibleNames[8]
