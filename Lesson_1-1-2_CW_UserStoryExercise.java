/*  Select an industry that makes something: cars, airplanes, boats, houses, computers, 
clothing, or anything else you choose.
Next decide on three users that have something to do with that object.  I suggest a manufacturer, 
a sales or maintenance person and a regular user.
For example, I picked Crayons.
Here is the beginnings of a userStory:
The manufacturer needs molds for the wax, dyes for the colors, wax, paper for the crayon wrapper, 
ink and printing equipment to print the wrapper and box, and cardboard for the box.
The sales person needs shelving, a price for each size box, signs and displays, maybe some cute 
posters colored by children or a coloring contest to help sell crayons.  This person 
also needs to know the number of types of boxes of crayons, the number of crayons in each type of 
box, inventory of how many of each box, how many have been sold and how many are 
on order.
The customer needs to know if the crayons are safe, the price of the box, some information on what 
size box to buy, how easily they break, what surfaces the crayons with color and 
the age group for the different sizes of crayons.

As a software engineer, I need decide to figure out what data each type of user needs, then I need 
to write that data as part of an object.  We will learn how to put this in a object later.

For the manufacturer:
double waxInTons = 45.5;
String [] dyeColors = {"red", "magenta", "green", "blue"};  //many more should be added later
double gallonsOfInk = 12;
String [] colorsOfInk =  {"red", "magenta", "green", "blue"};
int feetOfCardboard = 112;
boolean haveEnoughPaper = true;
